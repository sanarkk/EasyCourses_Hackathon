> About

This website was developed for University, and with this website students can choose courses which they want to learn. We developed user authentication and authorization connected to MongoDB, but unfortunately we haven't had enough time to connect courses with the database, so we just hardcoded page with courses, and with vanilla javascript developed the ability for students to choose some courses. Our chatbot has two options for students, first is a step-by-step guide on how to register for courses, and second is ability to register for call appointment. All data is saved into the database, and technical support workers are able to get this information, also the database has an auto clearing feature which deletes records which are older than 3 days.
