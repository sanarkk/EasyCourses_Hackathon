             <p>Easy Course, as the name suggests, allows you to register for university courses in an easy and efficient way.
            The website's 'Senior Connect' feature allows junior students to connect with their seniors and get an experienced insight 
            into the course from those who've already taken it. The engaging student-friendly course directory allows students to
            look up their courses for availability and get notified when it's available. We even have a chat-bot to help you out
            with the overwhelming content on the website.</p>
